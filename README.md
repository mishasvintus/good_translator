# GoodTranslator - A Minimalistic Python Translator

GoodTranslator is a lightweight, user-friendly translation application built with Python. It allows you to translate text between multiple languages using Google Translator from and vocalize it using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). The application features a clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) powered by `tkinter`.

## Disclaimer

- The design was developed for MacOS systems, there are no guarantees that on other systems or in newer versions of MacOS, the application will look the same. Moreover, shortcuts are MacOS friendly only (use of Command button)

- GoodTranslator uses aesthetic JetBrains Mono font and it must be installed on your system. So if it's not, use JetBrainsMono.ttf provided in the root of the repository. Otherwise, system default font will be used.

## Features

- **Text Translation**: Translate text between over 100 languages using the `deep_translator` library.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Listen to the translated text using Google's TTS (`gTTS`).
- **Language Swap**: Easily swap source and target languages with a single click.
- **Customizable Language Selection**: Choose source and target languages by entering language codes (e.g., `en` for English, `fr` for French) or the full language name (e.g., `english`, `french`, `spanish`).
- **Persistent Configuration**: Source and target languages you preferred are saved for future use. Even after restarting GoodTranslator
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use shortcuts for common actions like copy, paste, and select all.

## How is it implemented?

The application leverages several Python libraries to deliver its functionality. Here's a breakdown of what some of libraries are used for:

### 1. **Translation**

- **`deep_translator`** 1.11.4: Powers the core translation functionality. It uses **Google Translate** to convert text between over 100 languages.

### 2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

- **`gtts` (Google Text-to-Speech)** 2.5.4: Converts translated text into speech using Google's TTS API.
- **`pygame`** 2.6.1: Plays the audio generated by `gtts` in the application.

### 3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

- **`tkinter`** built-in Python: The foundational library for creating the GUI.
    - Maybe it will be replaced with `customtkinter` module in future.

### 4. **Configuration and File Management**

- **`appdirs`** 1.4.4: Manages platform-specific directories for storing configuration files.
- **`json`** built-in Python: Handles reading and writing configuration data in JSON format.
- **`os`** built-in Python: Manages file paths and directories for configuration and resource files.

### 5. **Utilities**

- **`io`** built-in Python: Handles in-memory byte streams for audio playback.

## Installation

### For macOS (Apple Silicon)

Pre-built packages are included in the project for MacBooks with Apple Silicon with MacOS 15.0+

1. **DMG Installer**:
    - Path: `./GoodTranslator.dmg`
    - Double-click to mount ‚Üí Drag the app to your `Applications` folder.
2. **Pre-built Application**:
    - Path: `./dist/GoodTranslator.app`
    - Double-click to launch.
        - *If macOS blocks the app*, run this command in Terminal:
        
        ```bash
        xattr -cr GoodTranslator.app
        ```
        

---

### For Other Cases

### 1. Run via Python (All OS)

Install dependencies and run manually: 

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pygame customtkinter gtts deep-translator appdirs

# Launch the app
python ./src/main.py

```

---

### 2. Build the Application (Advanced)

### macOS:
Before building you should install brew and make 
```bash
brew install npm
npm install -g create-dmg
```

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pygame customtkinter gtts deep-translator appdirs

# Install pyinstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build .app bundle
pyinstaller --windowed --name GoodTranslator --icon=./icons/icon.icns ./src/main.py

# The executable will be in the `dist/` folder
# If you want to make DMG-installer to install then full-fledged application:
create-dmg --no-sign ./dist/GoodTranslator.app  
```

### Windows:

```bash
# Install pyinstaller
pip install pyinstaller

# Build .exe
pyinstaller --windowed --name GoodTranslator --icon=./icons/icon.ico ./src/main.py

# The executable will be in the `dist/` folder
```

### Important Notes

### All OS:

- Use Python 3.9+ and a virtual environment for best results.

### macOS Builds:

- Ensure `python-tk` is installed:
    
    ```bash
    brew install python-tk
    
    ```
    
- If you encounter Tcl/Tk errors, set the library path:
    
    ```bash
    export TK_LIBRARY=/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/lib
    
    ```
    

### Windows Builds:

- Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if not already installed.

### Icons:

- Platform-specific icons (`.icns` for macOS, `.ico` for Windows) are provided in the project folder ./icons for building.
